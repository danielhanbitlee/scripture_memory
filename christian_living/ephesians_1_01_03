1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
    To the saints who are at Ephesus and 
                  who are faithful in Christ Jesus: 
2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
      who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing 
          in the heavenly places in Christ,
