1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God,
    To the saints 
      who are at Ephesus and 
      who are faithful in Christ Jesus: 
2 Grace to you and peace from 
    God our Father and 
    the Lord Jesus Christ.
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
    who has blessed us 
      with every spiritual blessing 
        in the heavenly places 
          in Christ, 
4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, 
    that we would be holy and blameless before Him. 
In love 5 He predestined us to adoption as sons 
  through Jesus Christ to Himself, 
  according to the kind intention of His will, 
  6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, 
      which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. 
7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, 
    the forgiveness of our trespasses, 
      according to the riches of His grace 
        8 which He lavished on us. 
In all wisdom and insight 
  9 He made known to us the mystery of His will, 
      according to His kind intention 
        which He purposed in Him
