7 But whatever things were gain to me, 
    those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 
8 More than that, I count all things to be loss 
    in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, 
      for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and 
      count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, 
      9 and may be found in Him, 
          not having a righteousness of my own 
            derived from the Law, 
          but that which is through faith in Christ, 
          the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, 
      10 that I may know Him and 
         the power of His resurrection and 
         the fellowship of His sufferings, 
           being conformed to His death; 
           11 in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
12 Not that I have already obtained it or 
              have already become perfect, 
     but I press on so that I may lay hold of that 
       for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus. 
13 Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; 
     but one thing I do: 
       forgetting what lies behind and 
       reaching forward to what lies ahead, 
       14 I press on toward the goal 
            for the prize 
              of the upward call of God 
                in Christ Jesus.
